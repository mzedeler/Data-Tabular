        - Remvoed spell.t as it fails on many systems and is only need
          for development.
        - Skipping in t/spreadsheet.t was not correct.
	- removed references to Data::Tabular::XML as it does not exist yet.
        - fix to Data::Tabular::Extra::get() method. It now works
          correctly in an array context.
